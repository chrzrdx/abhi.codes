# Heading 1

Some introductory paragraph text. Now let's showcase some **formatting**.

## Heading 2

This is a paragraph containing *italicized text* and **bold text**. 

Here is a Markdown quote:

> This is a quote spanning multiple lines to see how the styles handle line wrapping and spacing. Did it look nice? What about code blocks below?

### Heading 3

Here comes an unordered list:

- First item[^2]
- Second item
- Third item

And now an ordered list:  

1. First item 
2. Second item
3. Third item

Including links is common:

Here is [a link to example.com](https://www.example.com).

An image would also be useful:  

{/* ![Example image](./placeholder.png) */}

And code blocks of course:

```
Regular code blocks
  - Something
  - Something else
```

```python
# Python code example
x = 10
print(x) 
```

Adding a table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|  
| Row 1    | Data     | More data |
| Row 2    | 123      | 456 |
